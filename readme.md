If you are installing the dependencies, you can just run installBuildRun.sh.

# Running on Linux
Clone this repo

Change permission for build.sh and run
``` sh
chmod +x build.sh
build.sh
```

If that doesn't work, try pointing to AF:
```sh
export ArrayFire_DIR=~/AFPiBenchmark/ArrayFire-3.9.0-Linux/share/ArrayFire/cmake/
```

Change permission for runAll.sh and run

``` sh
chmod +x runAll.sh
runAll.sh
```
